# to a file, it detects this and does not colour-highlight
# To make the patch file *include* colours, change the option
# below to 'yes'

# Sometimes it can be useful to specify which diff command to
# use: that can be specified here

# available colours are: white, yellow, green, blue,
#                        cyan, red, magenta, black,

# this, use the default output colour"
